Thickbox is a simple popup creator that can be used to display all types of content, from `AJAX` forms, external pages and image galleries.

### Features

- Built using the super lightweight jQuery library.
- Resize images that are bigger than the browser window.
- Versatility (`images`, `iframed` content, `inline` content, and `AJAX` content).
- Hides form elements in Windows IE 6.
- Remain centered in the window even when the user scrolls the page or changes the size of the browser window. 
- Clicking an image, the overlay, or close link will remove the Thickbox.
- Due to the ThickBox creator's view that transitions should be tailored by individual authors, ThickBox windows do not implement fancy transitions. Feel free to add them as you see fit. Is this a feature? Well, some might say it is.
- Can be invoked from a link element, input element (typically a button), and the area element (image maps).


This help was taken from [the thickbox site](http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/) and covers most of the usage, just wanted it up here as the site says its not being worked on any more so never know if it is going to be taken down.
