Thickbox for Infinitas
================================================================================

Drop this into the plugins dir (installer is on the way) and give your links the
class of "thickbox" and the rest is magic. Css and Js are automaticaly injected
into the layout using the onRequireJs / onRequireCss Events. By default it will
automaticaly be a vailable on any page in the frontend of your site.

You may adjust the private method __needAssets() if you need to change where
thickbox is available. eg  if you want it all over admin / fronend just return
true, if you just want it for a certain controller/action pair something like
return $data['controller'] == 'my_controller' && $data['action'] == 'my_action';

there are the following options:
Size:
	add '?height=300&width=300' to your url to set a size of 300x300
	if you dont add sizes it will default to 630x440
	string form:
		$this->Html->link('my link', '/my_controller/my_action/?height=300&width=300')

	array form:
		array(
			'controller' => 'my_controller',
			'action' => 'my_action',
			'?height=300&width=300'
		)
Iframe:
	add 'TB_iframe=true' to open the content in an iframe

Modal box:
	add 'modal=true' to the url so that only clicking close will close the popup

Inline content:
	add 'inlineId=xyz' where xyz is the id of the content you want displayed.

Gallery mode:
	use rel to group images together. images with the same 'rel' attribute will
	display in the gallery together.

Features
================================================================================
ThickBox was built using the super lightweight jQuery library. Compressed, the
	jQuery library is 20k, uncompressed it's 58k.

The ThickBox JavaScript code and CSS file only add an additional 15k (only 10k
	by using the thickbox-compressed.js) on top of the jQuery code. The CSS file
	could additionally be compressed if need be.

ThickBox will resize images that are bigger than the browser window.

ThickBox offers versatility (images, iframed content, inline content, and AJAX
	content).

ThickBox will hide form elements in Windows IE 6.

ThickBox will remain centered in the window even when the user scrolls the page
	or changes the size of the browser window. Clicking an image, the overlay,
	or close link will remove ThickBox.

Due to the ThickBox creator's view that transitions should be tailored by
	individual authors, ThickBox windows do not implement fancy transitions.
	Feel free to add them as you see fit. Is this a feature? Well, some might
	say it is.

ThickBox can be invoked from a link element, input element (typically a button),
	and the area element (image maps).


Usage
================================================================================
Single image:
	to use for a single image do something like this.
	$this->Html->link(
		$this->Html->image('my_image.png'),
		'/img/my_image.png',
		array(
			'class' => 'thickbox'
		)
	);

Gallery:
	sets of images with next / prev buttons

	$this->Html->link(
		$this->Html->image('my_image1.png'),
		'/img/my_image1.png',
		array(
			'class' => 'thickbox',
			'rel' => 'my-gallery-1'
		)
	);
	$this->Html->link(
		$this->Html->image('my_image2.png'),
		'/img/my_image2.png',
		array(
			'class' => 'thickbox',
			'rel' => 'my-gallery-1'
		)
	);
	$this->Html->link(
		$this->Html->image('my_image3.png'),
		'/img/my_image3.png',
		array(
			'class' => 'thickbox',
			'rel' => 'my-gallery-2'
		)
	);
	$this->Html->link(
		$this->Html->image('my_image4.png'),
		'/img/my_image4.png',
		array(
			'class' => 'thickbox',
			'rel' => 'my-gallery-2'
		)
	);
NOTE:
You can also use the keyboard to move through the gallery, and the images will be
displayed in the same order they are in in the html


Inline content:
	$this->Html->link(
		'cool link',
		'#TB_inline?height=300&width=300&inlineId=myContent',
		array(
			'class' => 'thickbox'
		)
	);

	where you would have something like the following in your page.
	<div id="myContent">...blaa blaa...</div>

NOTE:
If the inline content in the ThickBox contains more content than the ThickBox
dimensions will show, a vertical scroll bar will appear so that the content can
be scrolled. You can avoid having the scroll by making sure the ThickBox has the
appropriate dimensions in order to show all of the inline content without having
to scroll. In other words, if you don't want scroll bars, increase the height
and width of the ThickBox until the content does not require scrolling.

Iframe content:
	$this->Html->link(
		'google',
		'http://google.co.uk/?q=some+search&TB_iframe=true&height=400&width=600',
		array(
			'class' => 'thickbox'
		)
	);
NOTE:
Add all other query parameters before the TB_iframe parameters. Everything after
the "TB" is removed from the URL.

Ajax content:
	$this->Html->link(
		'some ajax',
		array(
			'controller' => 'my_controller',
			'action' => 'my_action',
			123 // passed params
		)
		array(
			'class' => 'thickbox'
		)
	);

This help was taken from http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/ and covers most of
the usage, just wanted it up here as the site says its not being worked on any
more so never know if it is going to be taken down.
